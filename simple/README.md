# Exporting a simple scene using the CE.SDK Renderer docker container commandline interface

## Running the sample

1. Make sure you've set up [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or a compatible container engine on your machine.
2. Run `./demo.sh` in your shell, or `IMGLY_LICENSE=... ./demo.sh` if you already have a valid license key.
